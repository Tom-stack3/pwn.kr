# pwnable.kr and more
Writeups for pwnable.kr challenges and some fun challenges I've written for beginners.

### [Buffy's Nightmare]
A short series of challenges for beginners. The challenges are written in C and are designed to be solved using basic techniques. Note that the challenges are meant to be solved in order.

There are explanations for each challenge, and I've tried to make them as beginner-friendly as possible :upside_down_face:

There's source code for each challenge, a `make` file to compile, and a solution.

If you're new to binary exploitation, this might be a good place to start. If you're not, try the fourth challenge for some fun. Have fun!

> I will post writeups for challenges in categories other than the `Toddler's Bottle` only if I see that the challenge is solved by many people and that there are already easily findable writeups online for that particular challenge.
